This is the PintOS group project I undertook as part of my University Degree.

It is a monolithic operating system framework in C99 for the 80x86 architecture.

For this project, we were tasked to implement features for the operating system based on a specification. 
These included priority scheduling, multilevel feedback queue scheduling, support for user programs, a system call infrastructure and virtual memory.
